Abstract
The validity of day trading as a long-term consistent and uncorrelated source of
income for traders and investors is a matter of debate. In this paper, we investigate the profitability of the well-known Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy
during the period of 2016 to 2023. This period encompasses two bear markets and
a few events with abnormal volatility. Our results suggest that with the proper
use of leverage or leveraged products (such as 3x leveraged ETFs), day trading
can empirically produce significant returns when compared to a standard buy and
hold strategy on benchmark indexes in the US public equity markets (Nasdaq or
NYSE). Without any loss of generality, we studied the results of an ORB strategy
implemented in QQQ. By comparing the results of the active day trading approach
with a passive exposure in QQQ, we prove that it is possible for the ORB portfolio
to significantly outperform the passive investment. In fact, the day trading portfolio produced an annualized alpha of 33% (net of commissions). Nevertheless, due
to leverage constraints enforced by brokers, an active trader would have capped
the full upside potential given by the ORB strategy. To overcome this issue, we
introduced the use of TQQQ, a leveraged ETF of QQQ, which allows day traders to
fully exploit the benefit of the active strategy while adhering to leverage constraints.
The resulting portfolio would have earned an outstanding return of 1,484% during
the same period of 2016 to 2023, while an investment in the QQQ ETF would have
earned only 169%.

1 Introduction
Day trading has become an increasingly popular approach to trading in recent years,
particularly among retail investors. With the advent of new trading technologies and
increased access to financial markets, more and more individuals are turning to day trading as a way to potentially generate significant returns. In fact, the rise of retail day
traders has been so pronounced that it has been described as a “boom” in the industry.
However, it was not until the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020 that retail day trading
experienced a truly explosive growth (Baek and Jackman, 2021; Caferra and Vidal-Tom´as,
2021). With lockdowns and work from home policies in place, people found themselves
with more time on their hands and many turned to day trading as a way to supplement
their income or simply to pass the time. The impact of this surge in retail day trading
was felt throughout the financial markets, with notable examples of retail traders making
major gains in the stock market, the cryptocurrency market, and other major financial
markets (Caferra and Vidal-Tom´as, 2021). For instance, in August 2020, shares of Tesla
soared over 70% in just two weeks, driven in part by retail traders piling into the stock.
Similarly, in January 2021, a group of retail traders on Reddit managed to squeeze short
sellers out of their positions in GameStop, causing the stock to skyrocket by over 1,600%
(Anand and Pathak, 2022).
Despite the growing popularity of day trading and the potential profitability of certain
strategies, there are still many who doubt its validity as a long-term consistent approach
to trading. This skepticism stems from a number of concerns, including the perceived
difficulty of consistently generating profits through short-term trades, the potential for
high transaction costs and taxes, and the risks associated with leveraging and margin
trading (Yang et al., 2020).
For example, Chague et al., in a study published in 2020, showed that it was virtually
impossible for individuals to day trade the Brazilian equity futures market (ranked third
in the world in terms of volume) between 2013 and 2015. They reported that 97% of
all traders who traded more than 300 days in that period lost money (Chague et al.,
2020). As another example, Barber et al. investigated the performance of day traders in
2
Taiwan trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange between 1992 and 2006. They concluded
that less than 1% of those day traders were able to predictably and reliably earn positive
abnormal returns net of fees (Barber et al., 2019). Additionally, some critics argue that
day trading is essentially a form of gambling and that its success is largely based on luck
rather than skill. They contend that day traders are simply trying to beat the market in
the short term, rather than focusing on building long-term wealth through sound investment principles (Dorn et al., 2014; H˚akansson et al., 2021).
On the other hand, supporters of day trading argue that, when done correctly, it can be
a valid and profitable approach to trading. They note that successful day traders employ
rigorous risk management strategies, rely on proven trading methodologies, and stay disciplined and focused in the face of market volatility (Aziz, 2015; Jordan and Diltz, 2019;
Aaziznia and Aziz, 2020; Aziz, 2018; Turner, 2007; Conegundes and Pereira, 2020).
Ultimately, the validity of day trading as a long-term consistent approach to trading is a
matter of debate. While there are certainly risks involved and success is never guaranteed,
many traders continue to find success through careful planning, disciplined execution, and
a commitment to ongoing learning and improvement.
One popular strategy employed by day traders is the n-minute ORB strategy (Aziz, 2015).
As shown in Figure 1, this approach usually involves identifying the high and low points
of a stock during the first n-minutes of trading, and then buying or selling when the
stock breaks out of this range. A more simplistic version of this strategy can be obtained
by buying or selling at the open of the second candle in the same direction of the first
n-minute candle. This strategy is often used because it can generate quick profits, with
traders looking to capitalize on the volatility that can occur at the beginning of the trading day. Aziz et al. have released several publications on using the ORB strategy in the
US stock market (Aziz, 2015; Aaziznia and Aziz, 2020; Aziz, 2018).
The objective of this paper is to examine the performance of the 5-minute ORB and to
determine if it can beat a passive exposure on a well-known market index. Moreover,
this paper clearly identifies the benefits for day traders obtained by the introduction of

leveraged ETFs.
Our analysis was conducted during the period of January 1, 2016 to February 17, 2023.
By increasing the sample period, the significance of our results would have been higher;
nevertheless, due to changes in market dynamics and liquidity, we preferred to focus our
empirical investigation on the most recent years.
Overall, this paper aims to contribute to the growing body of research on day trading
strategies as well as provide valuable insights for both retail and institutional traders
seeking to improve their performance in the market.
2 Strategy Definition
As previously referenced, a 5-minute ORB strategy is a strategy that allows the trader
to bet on a breakout from the opening range during the first 5 minutes of the trading
session. We applied the ORB strategy on the QQQ ETF1
, which is the most liquid instrument available that replicates the Nasdaq Index. This strategy can take both a long
and a short exposure. Our model assumed that if there was to be an ORB, it would
occur in the same direction of the first 5-minute move. In other words, if during the
1The Invesco QQQ ETF holds a group of cutting-edge Nasdaq-100 companies known as the “tech sector”. Its portfolio includes a deep bench of innovators such as Apple, Alphabet (aka Google), Microsoft,
and more. QQQ has been a very popular trading and investing instrument since the dot-com bubble.

first 5 minutes the market moved up, we took a bullish position starting from the second
candle’s opening price. Conversely, if the first 5-minute candle was negative, we took a
bearish position at the open of the second 5-minute candle. No positions were opened
when the first 5-minute candle was a doji (open = close). The stop loss was placed at
the low of the day (which was the low of the first 5-minute candle) for a long trade, and
at the high of the day (which was the high of the first 5-minute candle) for a short trade,
as shown conceptually in Figure 1. The distance between the entry price and the stop is
labeled as Risk($R).
We set the profit target at 10x the $R. Should the target not have been reached by the end
of the day (EoD), we liquidated the position at market closure. We assumed a starting
capital of $25,000, a maximum leverage of 4x, and a commission of $0.0005/share traded.
The trading size was calibrated such that if a stop was hit, we lost 1% of our capital. We
used a 1% risk budget per trade as the historical average daily move on QQQ is 1%.
The summary of our model input variables is shown in Table 2. It is important to note
that we deliberately kept the model very simple and did not try to “optimize” the parameters for better performance. The goal of this paper is to empirically compare the
performance of a simple ORB strategy with a simple buy and hold market benchmark,
and not to introduce a highly optimized, high-performance trading algorithm.
The appropriate share size was calculated by factoring in the size of the trading account,
the amount of $R, the percentage of the capital we wanted to risk per trade (1%), and
the maximum leverage allowed by the broker (explained in more detail by Elder (2014)
and Aziz (2015, 2018)). Accordingly, the formula utilized was:
Shares = int 
min 
A × 0.01
$R
,
4 × A
P
 ,
where Shares represents the number of shares to be bought or sold, P is the opening
price of the second 5-minute candle, A denotes the size of the trading account, and $R is
the risk being assumed, calculated as $R = P - StopPrice. The function int is used to ensure that the share count is a whole number, as trading fractions of a share is not possible.

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 2 compares the equity curve performance of the 5-minute ORB strategy with the
equity curve performance of an equivalent passive investment in the benchmark (i.e.,
QQQ). The economic outperformance is significant: a $25,000 day trading account on
January 1, 2016 would be worth $192,806 (net of commissions) as of February 17, 2023.
That is an outstanding total return of 675%. On the other hand, the benchmark would be
worth $67,307, which corresponds to a total return of 169%. To gauge the outperformance

of the active strategy in excess of market risk (or benchmark risk), we ran the following
regression2 on daily returns:
RetORB QQQ = α + β × RetQQQ.
The annualized alpha was 33% (net of commissions) and is highly significant (p.value =
0.0025). The beta coefficient was not statistically different from zero, which implies that
our active approach was not correlated with the benchmark.
2The α can be interpreted as the return of the strategy in excess of the market risk. The β component
describes the correlation and leverage of the strategy returns with respect to passive QQQ returns.

Figure 3: A bar chart that represents the daily PnL (expressed in unit of Risk) of the ORB portfolio
that day traded the QQQ ETF (both long and short). All conditions were set as Table 2.
The unsignificant level of beta suggests that over the backtested period, the active strategy switched equally from long to short, reducing the level of correlation with respect to
a passive long only exposure on QQQ. In fact, out of 1,795 trades, 51% were long trades
while 49% were short. The annualized Sharpe Ratio was 1.12 while the annualized rate
of return was 31%.
As exhibited in Figure 3, we further analyzed the results of the strategy by plotting the
time-series of the daily PnL (normalized by the $R). As expected, due to the stop loss in
place, the maximum daily loss was capped at -1R (a bit larger due to commissions). On
the other hand, profits were capped at 10R. Profits were often below 10R, which means
that the position was liquidated at market closure and the 10R profit was not reached.
The Win Rate of the strategy was 24%, which made the average PnL per trade equal to
0.13R. A low accuracy was compensated by the asymmetry between gains and losses.
A further analysis of the historical PnL of the strategy suggested that many trades were
not traded in full-size and the overall PnL therefore ended up being just a fraction of the
R
3
. The reason for this “anomaly” is found in the leverage limit imposed by the broker.
As referenced in the strategy description, most US brokers do not allow intraday traders
to take positions more than 4x greater than the net liquidation value of their portfolio.
3This can be easily captured by observing the losses that were usually a fraction of 1R, see Figure 3.

Figure 4: A comparison between the equity curve performance of the ORB portfolio that day traded
the QQQ ETF (both long and short) without any leverage constraints, the equity curve performance of
the ORB portfolio that day traded the QQQ ETF (both long and short) with leverage constraints, and
the equity curve performance of the portfolio that passively utilized a simple buy and hold strategy in
QQQ. Gray highlighting has been used to show when there were bear markets. Other conditions were
set as Table 2.
This rule implies that in most trades, we were not able to put at risk 1performance of
our ORB QQQ strategy with the equity curve performance of an ORB QQQ strategy
without any leverage constraints. The results are exhibited in Figure 4% of the portfolio
value (as per the strategy description). An attentive reader will wonder at this point
whether the result obtained is suboptimal. To answer this question, we compared the
equity curve performance of our ORB QQQ strategy with the equity curve performance
of an ORB QQQ strategy without any leverage constraints. The results are exhibited in
Figure 4.
9
The gap between the equity curve performance of our ORB QQQ strategy and the equity curve performance of the unconstrained leverage version of it is quite significant.
The unconstrained version would have grown in the sample period by 1,630%, which is
approximately 2x the growth of our ORB QQQ strategy. Leverage constraints do not
allow an ORB trader to properly size each trade. Over the sample period, we estimate
that 60% of the trades were conducted with an exposure 40% below the optimal exposure
given by the unconstrained leverage version of the ORB strategy. In conclusion, the first
implementation of the ORB strategy in QQQ, even if attractive from a return-to-risk
perspective, does not fully exploit its edge over time.
To address this issue, we introduced the use of ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ4
), a
leveraged and liquid ETF that gives traders a 3x exposure to the daily fluctuation of
QQQ. We surmised that the introduction of TQQQ would allow traders to circumvent
the issue related to leverage constraints. In fact, a $100 exposure in TQQQ should be
approximately equal, on a daily basis, to a $300 exposure on QQQ. Assuming a maximum
leverage of 4x, it means that a $25,000 account may be exposed to the same $ daily moves
obtained by a $300,000 account fully invested in QQQ.
We ran the 5-minute ORB strategy on TQQQ and plotted the results in Figure 5. The
portfolio tracked very closely the value arising from the implementation of the unconstrained version of the ORB strategy on QQQ. The use of TQQQ improved significantly
the results of the ORB strategy and an astonishing total return of 1,484% was achieved
during the 7-year period. The outperformance versus the passive benchmark is evident
and confirmed by the results of the following regression:
4TQQQ is one of the largest ETFs with assets under management of $13.13 billion (as of 21 March
2023). Due in part to QQQ’s popularity, issuers of leveraged ETFs have tapped traders’ thirst for more
exotic ways to play the Nasdaq-100. TQQQ’s objective is simple: to deliver triple the daily returns of
the Nasdaq-100. Therefore, if that index rises by 1% on a particular day, TQQQ should jump by 3%.
As is the case with any leveraged ETF, TQQQ is an instrument best used over intraday time frames,
not as a buy and hold investment. Investors and traders who do not consider themselves “active” and
“risk-tolerant” should eschew leveraged ETFs. In a paper published in 2021, Lewis investigated the longterm investing in 3x leveraged ETFs and concluded that as a result of daily rebalancing and so-called
“beta slippage” or “the constant leverage trap”, it is highly likely that over the long term, the result of
leveraged ETFs will significantly deviate from the targeted leverage and, in so doing, generate wipeout
losses. In fact, his data show that many 3x leveraged ETFs have performed poorly over the long term
in the period of their existence.

Figure 5: A comparison between the equity curve performance of the ORB portfolio that day traded
the QQQ ETF (both long and short) without any leverage constraints, the equity curve performance
of the ORB portfolio that day traded the TQQQ ETF (both long and short), and the equity curve
performance of the portfolio that passively utilized a simple buy and hold strategy in QQQ and TQQQ.
Gray highlighting has been used to show when there were bear markets. All conditions were set as Table
2.
RetORB TQQQ = α + β × RetQQQ.
The annualized alpha was 48% (net of commissions) (p.value = 0.0013) while the beta
coefficient remained not statistically different from zero. The Sharpe Ratio was 1.19 and
the annualized rate of return was 46%. During the same period, the passive benchmark
(QQQ) would have earned an annualized return of 15% (169% total return).
As exhibited in Figure 6, by plotting the time-series of the daily PnL (in unit of Risk), we
noticed that the average gain increased significantly (versus the ORB strategy in QQQ)
11
Figure 6: A bar chart that represents the daily PnL (expressed in unit of Risk) of the ORB portfolio
that day traded the TQQQ ETF (both long and short).
and the resulting average PnL per trade was 0.18R (versus 0.13R for the ORB strategy
in QQQ). There were only 10% of days when the exposure was capped by the leverage
constraints, and in those few cases, the reduction of the exposure was approximately 30%.
The market regime from 2016 to 2023 was challenging. Although we did experience a nice
bull market in the US stock market, some major events caused short-term significant corrections with spikes in volatility. For example, in 2018, we experienced a short volatility
shock coined “Volmageddon”, which resulted in the collapse of many large short volatility
players (Augustin et al., 2021). Moreover, in March 2020, we experienced a short-lived
but scary bear market due to COVID-19 and the effects of global lockdowns. The subsequent recovery was spectacular and unprecedented, triggering a 2-year strong bull market
led by the tech sector. As well, in 2022, we experienced a gradual and less volatile bear
market caused by the aggressive interest rate hikes of the Federal Reserve.
As can be seen in Figure 5, the ORB strategy worked well and was consistently profitable
in both bull and bear markets. Without a doubt, the active approach proposed by this
paper will allow a disciplined day trader to profitably navigate different market regimes
that can vary in terms of overall direction and volatility. Further, the outperformance of
the active approach is easily grasped during bear markets, when the passive benchmark
suffered from the decline of equity markets.

4 A Further Investigation
As previously mentioned, for the active approach described in the previous pages of this
paper, we did not try to optimize the parameters for better performance. As a consequence, a few of the parameters may be suboptimal and have room for improvement. We
decided to thus investigate the sensitivity of the overall results to changes in the stop loss
and profit target. The results were fascinating.
Instead of using the low or the high of the day for stop loss placement, we decided to
use a fraction of the 14-day average true range (ATR) for the stop loss. We surmised
that a fixed percentage of the ATR should be a better and more stable representation
of the volatility of the stock during the day. For the profit target, we ran an analysis
of profit targets that ranged from 1R to 10R and EoD. We noticed that the best results
were achieved, as shown in Figure 7, with tight stop losses (5% of the 14-day ATR) and
by keeping the trade active until EoD in order to maximize the possible R as the profit
target. This is a truly fascinating result, as it empirically confirms the correctness of
the commonly used saying to cut losses quickly (by having a small stop loss) and to let
profits run (by having a large profit target or by reaching EoD). The results are shown
graphically in Figure 8.
As can be seen in Figure 8, an ORB strategy on TQQQ implemented with a stop that
was equal to 5% of the 14-day ATR and without any profit target (the position was
liquidated at market closure), would have increased by 9,350% between January 1, 2016
and February 17, 2023, and would have produced an annualized alpha of 93% (net of
commissions). A $25,000 trading account would therefore have grown to $6,400,000 (net
of commissions). However, it is important to note that this result can under certain
13

circumstances be considered unrealistic as our model assumed no slippage. Given their
high volume and liquidity, when trading QQQ and TQQQ in small share sizes, a trader
can safely assume there will be small to no slippage. When trading with a large account
and a large share size, it is not safe to assume that trades will be executed without any
slippage. For example, the 14-day ATR of TQQQ as of February 2023 is around $1.60,
while TQQQ is trading at around $25 per share. A stop placed at 5% of the 14-day ATR
implies a stop width of $0.08. With a large account and a large share exposure, the stop
will likely be exceeded.
5 Conclusion
Based on the analysis we ran from 2016 to 2023, we can conclude that day trading QQQ
with an ORB approach can be a highly profitable strategy returning approximately 675%

Figure 8: A comparison between the equity curve performance of the ORB portfolio that day traded
the TQQQ ETF (both long and short) with a stop equal to 5% of the 14-day ATR and with EoD profit
taking, and the equity curve performance of the portfolio that passively utilized a simple buy and hold
strategy in QQQ and TQQQ. Gray highlighting has been used to show when there were bear markets.
Other conditions were set as Table 2
in 7 years (net of commissions). Moreover, our research found that the returns arising
from this strategy are uncorrelated with the overall market and produce a highly significant alpha (33% annualized, net of commissions). This strategy outperformed a passive
long only exposure in QQQ during both bull and bear markets.
Our research has also demonstrated the power of using leveraged ETFs such as TQQQ
to circumvent the leverage constraints imposed by the brokers that do not allow a trader
to fully exploit the edge given by their day trading strategy. In fact, by only trading
QQQ, the ORB exposure will be suboptimal 60% of the time, creating a major divergence between the realized returns and those achievable by an account with no leverage
constraints. By introducing the use of TQQQ, the returns of ORB improved significantly,
filling the gap between the previously implemented version and the unconstrained lever15
age strategy. The use of leveraged ETFs can thus increase the value of a trader’s US
stock market day trading account.
However, it is important to note that the use of leverage also increases the level of risk
involved in day trading and execution errors may have significant impacts on the value
of a trader’s day trading account. The main source of risk, at least in our framework,
is not coming from losses due to strategy failure (in fact, we always traded with a stop
loss regardless of whether we traded QQQ or TQQQ), but from operational risks such as
slippage (i.e., stops not properly executed), not respecting basic day trading rules (e.g.,
turning a day trade into a swing trade or a buy and hold position), exiting too early from
a position before reaching the final target, and so on.
In conclusion, our study provides empirical evidence that day trading can produce excellent and uncorrelated returns. The proposed ORB strategy can significantly enhance the
profitability of a trading account, but it requires a high level of effort and attention to
market fluctuation. Contrary to what is commonly believed by those who are skeptical
about the usefulness of using day trading strategies, we believe that there may be great
value in combining lower-frequency investments (such as long-term buy and hold equity
indexes) with higher-frequency approaches. Further, those willing to also diversify in
terms of trading frequencies should expect to generate better risk-adjusted returns.
